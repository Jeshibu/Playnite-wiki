### Uninstalled games not importing properly
Uplay client has to be started at least once (and user must be logged in) for Playnite to import all games properly. Uplay doesn't have to be running for import to work, only initial authentication in Uplay is important.

If you are still having issues then try deleting `c:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\cache\configuration\configurations` file, restarting Uplay and then try import in Playnite again. 

### Newly bought games not being imported
Uplay has to be started at least once after new game is added to your account for Playnite to properly recognize it.
