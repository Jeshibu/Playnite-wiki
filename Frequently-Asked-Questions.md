### Where can I find library folder with all games?

Go to `Settings` menu and check `Database Location` on `General` tab.

By default for installed versions the library is in `%appdata\Playnite\library` folder and for portable it's just `library` folder inside the application folder.

**Warning: Never combine two different library folders from different Playnite instances. It will generate duplicates in your library. If you are moving library to another Playnite instance always completely replace the folder, never just copy one over another.**

### Where are cover/background images stored?

All media files are stored in `Database Location` directory together with other game information.

### How do I update Playnite?

Playnite supports auto update feature, you don't have to download and install updates manually. Playnite checks for new version at every startup and then every 4 hours. You can also manually check if new version is available by using `Check for Updates` menu option.

### Where are Playnite settings located?

Portable editions have settings stored in `config.json` directly in Playnite's folder. Installed versions store settings in `%AppData%\Playnite\config.json` file.

### How do I unhide game?

Use **V** button next to the search field to open filter panel, select `Hidden` filter, right-click on hidden game and choose `Show in Library` option.
