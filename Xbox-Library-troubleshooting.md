### Not all installed games are imported

The game has to be started at least once to be properly picked by Playnite as installed. This will be most likely fixed in 7.1 update.

### Side loaded UWP apps are not detected

Playnite doesn't support side loaded games/apps. Only games/apps installed using official channels are supported.

### Supported systems

Import of installed games is only supported on Windows 10. Windows 8 version of Microsoft Store is not supported.

### Installation of console titles

Imported 360 and One games can't be installed or run from Playnite for obvious reasons. Support for steaming from Xbox One console will be considered in future.

### GFWL PC games are imported as 360 games

Microsoft's API doesn't recognize GFWL as a separate platform and reports those games as 360 titles. The only solution is to manually hide them.
