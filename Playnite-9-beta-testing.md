!!!IMPORTANT!!!
---------------------

This is a beta test release aimed to to test Playnite 9. It should NOT be used as a "daily driver" installation since it contains a lot of breaking changes that could potentially contain bugs resulting in data loss! It's also currently not guaranteed that this beta release will be upgradeable to stable one when it's available, although it's likely.

For that reason, use this beta as a separate installation or install it over portable **copy** of your main Playnite instance.

Playnite 9 contains a lot of breaking changes to the add-on SDK, which means that none of the existing 3rd party extensions and themes will work until they are updated by their developers.

Installation
---------------------

### Clean installations

Just unpack to a folder and run.

### Using existing data

If you use installed Playnite version:
- create new [portable copy](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-convert-installed-version-to-portable)
- delete `Extensions` and `Themes` folders from that copy
- unpack beta archive over portable copy

If you use portable Playnite version:
- create copy of your portable installation
- delete `Extensions` and `Themes` folders from that copy
- unpack beta archive over portable copy

Reporting issues
---------------------

If you encounter clear bug, open new issue in this repository the same way as for stable builds.
