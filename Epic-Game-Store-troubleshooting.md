### "pollingId is invalid" error when logging in

Currently [known issue](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/1416) when using 3rd party services (Google for example) to sing in into Epic account. The only solution right now is to [setup password](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/1416#issuecomment-534890200) on your Epic account.
