#### This is only basic idea what I would like to focus on. If more people will show interest in developing Playnite I will move to proper project management here on GitHub.

## Unsorted ideas, without assigned version
* Add non-PC platforms with support for emulators
* Add DOSBox configuration GUI
* Add additional launch options for legacy games (limit CPU cores, CPU speed fix, compatibility flags etc.)
* Option to minimize to tray
* Count play time
    * Maybe display some howlongtobeat.com data?
* Media tab, display internet stuff related to game (news, live streamers, YT videos etc.)
* Big picture with controller support
* Game save backup for custom games
