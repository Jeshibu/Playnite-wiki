#### This is only basic idea what I would like to focus on. If more people will show interest in developing Playnite I will move to proper project management here on GitHub.

## 0.70 -> 0.80

* **Done** - Better notification bar and progress bar
    * Current implementation moves the whole layout when visible
* **In Development** - More integration and UI tests
* [Service login improvements #12](../issues/12)
    * Show successful/unsuccessful login attempts to GOG/Origin in first time wizard and settings windows
    * Offer re-login when library download fails by clicking on notification
* [Better update dialog #13](../issues/13)
    * Show changes and new features from last version when Playnite updates
* [Options to reset metadata to default values #14](../issues/14)
    * Will re-download game metadata and images from provider site (Steam, GOG etc.) and reset them to default value
* [Option to scan folders for bulk addition of games #15](../issues/15)
* [Fix up theme #16](../issues/16)
* [Add some basic PC info into diagnostics packages (CPU, RAM, OS Version) #17](../issues/17)

## 0.80 -> 0.90

* [Add additional metadata providers #18](../issues/18)
* [Show (configurable?) more information about game (publishers, release date etc.) on game details view #19](../issues/19)
* [Speedup filters with partial reload of the view #20](../issues/20)
* [Sorting and filtering for all fields #21](../issues/21)

## 0.90 -> 1.00
* [High DPI support #22](../issues/22)
* [Translations #23](../issues/23)
* [Beta/Supporter branch support with separate updates #24](../issues/24)
* [Automatically relaunch when crash occurs (or provide option to do so from crash window) #25](../issues/25)

## Unsorted ideas, without assigned version
* Add non-PC platforms with support for emulators
* Add DOSBox configuration GUI
* Add additional launch options for legacy games (limit CPU cores, CPU speed fix, compatibility flags etc.)
* Automatically detect when 3rd party finishes installing/uninstalling game and update status in Playnite
* Task bar jump list support for last played games
* Option to minimize to tray
* Count play time
    * Maybe display some howlongtobeat.com data?
* Media tab, display internet stuff related to game (news, live streamers, YT videos etc.)
