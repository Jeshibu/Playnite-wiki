## Making themes
Documentation about theme editing can be found on our [SDK portal](https://playnite.link/docs/tutorials/themes/introduction.html).

## Downloading themes
There's currently no official database with user made themes. We will be launching new forums soon (probably by the end July), which will be used as theme database.

## Installing themes
See [this documentation page](https://playnite.link/docs/tutorials/themes/installing.html) about how to install custom theme.
