Controller is currently only supported in Fullscreen mode and only `XInput` compatible controllers are support at the moment. General `DirectInput` support is planned [in future](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/684).

If you want to use controller that doesn't support XInput by default then you need to use some kind of `DirectInput` to `XInput` wrapper.

Some wrapper available (not all of them):
