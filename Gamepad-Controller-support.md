Controllers are currently only supported in Fullscreen mode and only `XInput` compatible will work at the moment. General `DirectInput` support is planned [to be added in future](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/684).

If you want to use a controller that doesn't support XInput API, then you need to use some kind of `DirectInput` to `XInput` wrapper.

Some wrappers available (not all of them):

- [XOutput](https://github.com/csutorasa/XOutput)
