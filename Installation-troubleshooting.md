### Can't install into specific folder

Happens if the installer doesn't have permissions to write to selected destination. Use different location if that happens.

### Download fails

Make sure that your Firewall or Anti-malware software is not blocking the installer process.

### General failure

In case of general failure during installation, please let us know by [opening new bug report](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/issues/new/choose) and use offline installer until the issue is fixed.

### Offline installers

Offline installers can be downloaded from [releases page](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite/releases/latest). Use `exe` file for standard installation and `zip` for portable one. Please note that offline installer is not digitally signed and your AV or browser may report that the file is "potentially dangerous", which is not true.
